                <h1 class="h1__title">Laura Cowan &larr; What's In Your Pantry?</h1>

                <h3 class="">What’s in Your Pantry? is a recurring feature where I ask women to tell us more about their food and eating habits by opening up their kitchen pantries to us. This week I’m featuring Laura Cowan, a <a href="http://www.lauracowan.com/" target="_blank">contemporary Judaica designer and Jewish artist</a>.</h3>

                <p class="interview__question">Tell us a bit about yourself</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">I was born Manchester, England and grew up with my parents and two older brothers. My grandparents were very involved in the shul so we always kept kosher at home, something that is very important to me to pass on to my children. My eldest child is stricter than me!</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">My favorite subject at school was always Art and I knew one day I’d make a career out of it. I studied BA Hons Jewelry and Silversmithing at Sir John Cass at London Guildhall University. It was a perfect course for me because it combined design, silversmithing, art history and business studies. After my degree, I moved to Tel Aviv. I studied Hebrew in the morning, and in the afternoon I took an apprenticeship with a jeweler in Old Jaffa.</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">After a year, I was ready to move on and started looking at the rocket shaped jewelry that I had produced for my degree exhibition and realized they would make perfect mezuzahs. I set up a small studio on my balcony and experimented with copper, brass, and silver and produced various looks with different colored patinas.</p>

                <h4 class="h4__itemtitle">Rocket Shaped Mezuzahs</h4>

                <p class="interview__answer">I became vegetarian over 30 years ago for ideological reasons – over the years I have gone through phases of being less strict and eating fish and at the moment I am trying to reduce dairy, so I have started by swapping regular milk for almond milk</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">I have 3 kids aged 6, 9 and 12, who are all fussy eaters and don’t like any of the same foods so almost every meal I’d make three dishes for them – so I keep it super simple – baked potatoes with cream cheese, mashed avocado and Israeli salad, healthy pancakes (with whole wheat flour, coconut oil, almond butter and chia seeds) or spaghetti with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.</p>

                <p class="interview__question">How do you typically feel, emotionally, when you open your kitchen pantry?</p>
                
                <p class="interview__answer">Pretty relaxed really, anything that isn’t used on a regular basis I throw out as I believe the key to organization is to minimize.</p>
                
                <p class="interview__question">What’s your process for organizing your food pantry?</p>
                
                <p class="interview__answer">I studied home economics at school and we learned to keep items that you use together only one or two steps away from each other. I designed my kitchen galley style so it’s really easy to grab whatever I need quickly. Spices are in a pull out drawer next to the stove – I label the tops of the lids so I can see everything at a glance. Sweet or semi-junk food is on a high shelf so I think twice about taking something.</p>
                
                <p class="interview__question">What’s inside of your pantry right now?</p>

                <h3 class="">What’s in Your Pantry? is a recurring feature where I ask women to tell us more about their food and eating habits by opening up their kitchen pantries to us. This week I’m featuring Laura Cowan, a <a href="http://www.lauracowan.com/" target="_blank">contemporary Judaica designer and Jewish artist</a>.</h3>

                <p class="interview__question">Tell us a bit about yourself</p>
