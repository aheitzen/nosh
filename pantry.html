                    A Toast to Tradition: An interview with Russ and Daughters
                </h1>

                <h3 class="">
                    Family. Quality. Service. History. Soul. New York. Community. Few businesses embody these qualities as perfectly as the 101-year-old Russ and Daughters. We speak to the fourth generation running the institution.
                </h3>

                <p class="">
                    When Joel Russ emigrated from Austria-Hungary to the United States in 1907, he kicked off his career by selling strings of mushrooms that he carried on his shoulders. After running his business out of a pushcart and then a horse and wagon, Joel was able to open up his first brick-and-mortar “appetizing” shop in 1914 (first on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side, and later at the current location on East Houston Street in 1920).
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    During this time he and his wife, Bella, had three daughters: Hattie, Anne and Ida. Hattie began learning the business in 1924 and her sisters came in to help shortly after. The shop was renamed “Russ and Daughters” in 1933, which caused quite a ruckus in the neighborhood—women just didn’t run businesses in those days. Sadly, Joel passed away in 1961, and later Anne’s son Mark Russ Federman took over the shop in 1978.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    More recently, Joel’s great-grandchildren Joshua Russ Tupper and Niki Russ Federman (pictured) have been handed the torch to run, expand and modernize the store. R&D has been through a lot: During the Depression, Joel had to decide whether to sell the business or the family home, and he opted to sell the house, betting that saving the business would keep the family afloat. And now, 101 years later, Russ and Daughters is still going strong.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    R&D sells forshpayz, which means the foods you eat with bagels, such as smoked or cured fish, homemade salads and cream cheese. In 2014, the year that the original store celebrated 100 years in business, Niki and Joshua decided to open a <a href="http://www.russanddaughterscafe.com/" target="_blank">new sit-down café</a> on Orchard Street, very close to their great-grandfather’s original space (they also plan to open a shop/café in the Jewish Museum this spring). R&D has a loyal following that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal and Justice Ginsburg, and was also the subject of a documentary called The Sturgeon Queens in 2014.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    We interviewed cousins/fourth-generation owners Niki and Joshua about small-business longevity, family traditions and smoked fish.
                </p>

                <p class="interview__question">
                    What kind of experiences did you have in the shop as a kid?
                </p>

                <p class="interview__answer">
                    Josh: We’d go behind the candy counter, fill our pockets and then go to my grandmother’s house and have a big Russ and Daughters spread for lunch. My cousin and I would take bagels, put cream cheese on them and then proceed to put every single fish on top. My grandmother would yell at us: “How are you going to taste everything with salmon and sable and sturgeon and herring all on the same bagel?!”
                </p>

                <p class="interview__question">
                    Do you know of any other stores with “and Daughters” in the name?
                </p>

                <p class="interview__answer">
                    Niki: As far as we know, it was the first business in this country with “and Daughters,” and it’s still rare. You mostly see “and Sons,” “and Brothers,” “and Cousins.” I’d like to think my great-grandfather was this pioneering feminist making a political statement, but the sad truth is that he didn’t have any sons: He only had daughters. He also understood that it sounded like a good name, and maybe it wasn’t so bad if he stirred up a bit of controversy, which he did.
                </p>

                <p class="interview__question">
                    What are the challenges of running a family business?
                </p>

                <p class="interview__answer">
                    Niki: R&D is in a very rare minority of fourth-generation businesses. I’ve heard that only 1 percent of family businesses ever make it to a fourth generation. I joke that the secret to running a successful family business is to not have too much family involved. But there’s a benefit because there’s a level of trust there, which is hard to come by: Josh and I can cover for each other. In some family businesses there’s pressure or expectation on certain family members that this is something you have to do with your life, and that’s unfair. At some point people will realize that they’re not living the life they wanted. We have a very individualistic society and you’re supposed to do your own thing, not what your parents did. I had that prejudice for a long time, but traveling to Asia and Europe where I saw family businesses that have been going for ten generations made me appreciate the beauty of being part of a legacy. A family business can’t be a birthright. I didn’t inherit anything—I had to work hard and prove I was capable of doing this.
                </p>

                <p class="interview__question">
                    What has the family business taught you about longevity?

                <h3 class="">What’s in Your Pantry? is a recurring feature where I ask women to tell us more about their food and eating habits by opening up their kitchen pantries to us. This week I’m featuring Laura Cowan, a <a href="http://www.lauracowan.com/" target="_blank">contemporary Judaica designer and Jewish artist</a>.</h3>

                <p class="interview__question">Tell us a bit about yourself</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">I was born Manchester, England and grew up with my parents and two older brothers. My grandparents were very involved in the shul so we always kept kosher at home, something that is very important to me to pass on to my children. My eldest child is stricter than me!</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">My favorite subject at school was always Art and I knew one day I’d make a career out of it. I studied BA Hons Jewelry and Silversmithing at Sir John Cass at London Guildhall University. It was a perfect course for me because it combined design, silversmithing, art history and business studies. After my degree, I moved to Tel Aviv. I studied Hebrew in the morning, and in the afternoon I took an apprenticeship with a jeweler in Old Jaffa.</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">After a year, I was ready to move on and started looking at the rocket shaped jewelry that I had produced for my degree exhibition and realized they would make perfect mezuzahs. I set up a small studio on my balcony and experimented with copper, brass, and silver and produced various looks with different colored patinas.</p>

                <!--                <img src="../images/pantry2.jpg" alt="pantry2.jpg">-->

                <h4 class="h4__itemtitle">Rocket Shaped Mezuzahs</h4>

                <p class="interview__answer">I became vegetarian over 30 years ago for ideological reasons – over the years I have gone through phases of being less strict and eating fish and at the moment I am trying to reduce dairy, so I have started by swapping regular milk for almond milk</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">I have 3 kids aged 6, 9 and 12, who are all fussy eaters and don’t like any of the same foods so almost every meal I’d make three dishes for them – so I keep it super simple – baked potatoes with cream cheese, mashed avocado and Israeli salad, healthy pancakes (with whole wheat flour, coconut oil, almond butter and chia seeds) or spaghetti with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.</p>

                <p class="interview__question">How do you typically feel, emotionally, when you open your kitchen pantry?</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">Pretty relaxed really, anything that isn’t used on a regular basis I throw out as I believe the key to organization is to minimize.</p>

                <p class="interview__question">What’s your process for organizing your food pantry?</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">I studied home economics at school and we learned to keep items that you use together only one or two steps away from each other. I designed my kitchen galley style so it’s really easy to grab whatever I need quickly. Spices are in a pull out drawer next to the stove – I label the tops of the lids so I can see everything at a glance. Sweet or semi-junk food is on a high shelf so I think twice about taking something.</p>

                <p class="interview__question">What’s inside of your pantry right now?</p>

                <img src="../images/pantry3.jpg" alt="pantry3.jpg">

                <p class="interview__answer interview__answer--title"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jcnSOr" target="_blank">Star Anise</a></p>

                <p class="interview__answer">This 8-pointed star-shaped spice is so beautiful to look at! It looks stunning in cocktails, and tastes especially good in a white wine sangria. I buy them from a spice stall in <a href="http://en.shuktlv.co.il/category/carmel-market" target="_blank">Carmel market</a>.</p>

You won't find toppings here. They just started accepting credit cards this year. Hell, they won't even slice their bagels for you.<br>&emsp;NY native Terry Skolnick founded Bialy's in 1966, after moving to Cleveland, finding a Jewish name in a phonebook, and asking them the best place to open a bagel shop in Cleveland (yes, seriously). Since then Bialy's has become the bagel destination in Northeast Ohio. They city might have lost LeBron (again), but they'll always have Bialy's.</p>

Maybe it's the tradition! Maybe it's just a misguided sense of East Coast urban superiority! (It's probably a mix of all three).<br>&emsp;But as I get older -- and my horizons expand along with my waistline -- I've realized the rest of our fair nation does indeed have quality bagel options… as long as you know where to look. And if you don't know where to look, look here, at one of these 12 spots. While some of these bagel shops do an admirable job of mimicking the "New York" style, others try (and succeed!) at blazing their own, distinct, breaded path to breakfast food glory.<br>&emsp;And while this list may represent the best of the best, it only proves that great bagels don't depend on water, tradition, or location. All that matters is that bagel makers have passion, use quality ingredients, and actually care about the product they produce.<br>&emsp;Oh, and they have to have holes.<br>&emsp;If they didn't, they'd just be rolls with fancy toppings.</p>

                <h1 class="h1__title">Traditional Meal Ending Holy Days Becomes an Event
                </h1>

                <h3 class="">Here's a subtitle describing the Hot Takes series, and why you should read it and maybe tell your friends about it too.
                </h3>

                <p class="">When Jill Medvedow, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, was growing up, she broke her fast after Yom Kippur at home, with just her family. After she married, she would go to her mother-in-law’s house for the annual meal known as the break-fast. But when her mother-in-law left Boston, Ms. Medvedow and her husband became break-fast orphans.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    There was no shortage of invitations, but some of them seemed, well, unappetizing.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    “A number of break-fasts had gotten catered,” Ms. Medvedow said. “They were really big. They were parties. We wanted something homemade, intimate, flexible and warm, at the end of a day that we take seriously.”
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    In one sense, it’s hard to mess up a break-fast. Yom Kippur, which begins next Friday night and ends Saturday night, is the Jewish Day of Atonement, the culmination of 10 days of contemplation, self-renewal and rededication to the path of righteousness. After such extended religious labor, capped off by a day without food or drink, the parched and hungry Jew is happy with whatever nourishment comes.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/hottakes1.jpg" alt="hottakes1.jpg">

                <p class="">
                    But in recent years, the break-fast party has become part of the Jewish social calendar. From Los Angeles to Chicago to New York, many are attending large, crowded break-fasts, where the spirit of the High Holy Days can get lost in the mixing, and where the day’s solemnity quickly abates, smothered by large quantities of cream cheese and hummus.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    Vanessa Ochs, who teaches religion at the University of Virginia, says the new, bigger break-fast raises theological questions. Even before the day of repentance is over, many people are forced to think about the meal they will be serving.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    “In the last 25 years, the break-fast has, in some friendship groups, become such a moment for gratitude and coming together that people will stay home from services to cook and prepare,” Dr. Ochs said. “That isn’t what they’re supposed to be doing, but from a non-halakhic” — extra-legal — “perspective, if this meal marks who is in your friendship circle, and who is going to be there for you, then this is a holy communal feast.”

                <p class="interview__answer interview__answer--title"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jcnSOr" target="_blank">Star Anise</a></p>

                <p class="interview__answer interview__answer--title"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jcl1VY" target="_blank">Halva</a></p>

                <p class="interview__answer">My kids love this and although it contains a lot of sugar, it’s a great source of calcium. It also keeps for months. I buy it from <a href="http://saronamarket.co.il/en/%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%94" target="_blank">The Halva Kingdom in Sarona Market</a>. My kids love the chocolate version and my favorite is pistachio.</p>

                <p class="interview__answer interview__answer--title">Tomatoes</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">Lots of tins of tomatoes. I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2jX5TzA" target="_blank">this Italian brand</a> – they seem to taste much sweeter than other brands. I use these to make Shakshuka – a North African dish of onion, garlic, tomatoes, red peppers and lots of cumin and black cracked pepper – cooked and eaten in the same iron skillet with an egg poached directly in it. I like it sprinkled with lots of coriander and we eat it with a ripped-up loaf of the simplest bread.</p>


                <img src="../images/pantry_butter.jpg" alt="pantry_butter.jpg">

                <p class="interview__answer interview__answer--title">Local Salted Butter</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">I use <a href="http://www.tnuvausa.com/fresh-from-the-dairy/try-something-fresh/salted-butter" target="_blank">this kosher Israeli brand</a>. I love using this for cooking as well as baking, as I think the flavor is much better than unsalted. You might think of it as a regular staple but lately, in Israel, it’s been off the shelves due to a milk shortage – the farms don’t have enough for their milk sales so they are holding back on butter manufacture. My butter-loving friends and I update each other if we see it being sold anywhere.</p>


                <img class="" src="../images/pantry_olives.jpg" alt="pantry_olives.jpg">

                <p class="interview__answer interview__answer--title">Olives</p>

                <p class="interview__answer">In Israel everyone has a specific favourite. Mine are the small Souri (named after a Lebanese city) green cracked olives with pickled lemon. My favourite Israeli brand is called <a href="http://zetaoliveoil.co.il/product/%D7%96%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A2-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A9/" target="_blank">Zita</a>. I eat these alongside a simple Israeli salad and crackers with cream cheese.
