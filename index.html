                <p class="h3 h3__attr">By Gail O'Hara</p>
                <p class="fc__p--body">Family. Quality. Service. History. Soul. New York. Community. Few businesses embody these qualities as perfectly as the 101-year-old Russ and Daughters. We speak to the fourth generation running the institution.</p>
                <p class="fc__p--body">When Joel Russ emigrated from Austria-Hungary to the United States in 1907, he kicked off his career by selling strings of mushrooms that he carried on his shoulders. After running his business out of a pushcart and then a horse and wagon, Joel was able to open up his first brick-and-mortar “appetizing” shop in 1914 (first on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side, and later at the current location on East Houston Street in 1920).</p>
                <div class="test-shape">
                    <img class="circle" src="images/r&d-1.png">
                    <p class="fc__p--body">During this time he and his wife, Bella, had three daughters: Hattie, Anne and Ida. Hattie began learning the business in 1924 and her sisters came in to help shortly after. The shop was renamed “Russ and Daughters” in 1933, which caused quite a ruckus in the neighborhood—women just didn’t run businesses in those days. Sadly, Joel passed away in 1961, and later Anne’s son Mark Russ Federman took over the shop in 1978.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">More recently, Joel’s great-grandchildren Joshua Russ Tupper and Niki Russ Federman (pictured) have been handed the torch to run, expand and modernize the store. R&D has been through a lot: During the Depression, Joel had to decide whether to sell the business or the family home, and he opted to sell the house, betting that saving the business would keep the family afloat. And now, 101 years later, Russ and Daughters is still going strong.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="fc__p--body">R&D sells forshpayz, which means the foods you eat with bagels, such as smoked or cured fish, homemade salads and cream cheese. In 2014, the year that the original store celebrated 100 years in business, Niki and Joshua decided to open a new sit-down café on Orchard Street, very close to their great-grandfather’s original space (they also plan to open a shop/café in the Jewish Museum this spring). R&D has a loyal following that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal and Justice Ginsburg, and was also the subject of a documentary called The Sturgeon Queens in 2014.</p>
                <p class="fc__p--body">We interviewed cousins/fourth-generation owners Niki and Joshua about small-business longevity, family traditions and smoked fish.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What kind of experiences did you have in the shop as a kid?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Josh: </span>We’d go behind the candy counter, fill our pockets and then go to my grandmother’s house and have a big Russ and Daughters spread for lunch. My cousin and I would take bagels, put cream cheese on them and then proceed to put every single fish on top. My grandmother would yell at us: “How are you going to taste everything with salmon and sable and sturgeon and herring all on the same bagel?!”</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">“My mother wrote a list of people she wanted to be informed that she’d passed away, and Russ and Daughters was one of them.” Things like that happen all the time.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">Do you know of any other stores with “and Daughters” in the name?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>As far as we know, it was the first business in this country with “and Daughters,” and it’s still rare. You mostly see “and Sons,” “and Brothers,” “and Cousins.” I’d like to think my great-grandfather was this pioneering feminist making a political statement, but the sad truth is that he didn’t have any sons: He only had daughters. He also understood that it sounded like a good name, and maybe it wasn’t so bad if he stirred up a bit of controversy, which he did.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What are the challenges of running a family business?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>R&D is in a very rare minority of fourth-generation businesses. I’ve heard that only 1 percent of family businesses ever make it to a fourth generation. I joke that the secret to running a successful family business is to not have too much family involved. But there’s a benefit because there’s a level of trust there, which is hard to come by: Josh and I can cover for each other. In some family businesses there’s pressure or expectation on certain family members that this is something you have to do with your life, and that’s unfair. At some point people will realize that they’re not living the life they wanted. We have a very individualistic society and you’re supposed to do your own thing, not what your parents did. I had that prejudice for a long time, but traveling to Asia and Europe where I saw family businesses that have been going for ten generations made me appreciate the beauty of being part of a legacy. A family business can’t be a birthright. I didn’t inherit anything—I had to work hard and prove I was capable of doing this.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What has the family business taught you about longevity?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>The importance of taking the long view. We feel more like stewards who are entrusted with preserving and growing R&D so we’ll be able to hand it off to the next generation—of our family and our customers. We’re making decisions that will ensure the business will be around for another 100 years. Our longevity is due to quality. R&D has continuously been a part of New York history and a part of people’s lives for so long that it has become a geographic and emotional reference point. It helps people make sense of their lives. The second you step into R&D, you’re transported. It conjures up a memory: Where you went as a kid or eating with your grandparents or when you lived in New York. A guy walked in the door not too long ago and we kept saying, “Can we help you?” And he just stood there and said, “Can I just stand here for a second? I’m just so happy that you’re still here.” It’s more than just a store—it feels like a community center.</p>

                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">Do entrepreneurial qualities run in your family?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Josh: </span> It comes naturally to me. Even with inheriting a 100-year-old business, you need to grow the business and see the future. We determined that it was time to open a sit-down restaurant. From the family’s perspective, it has always just been a store, so there was pushback. You have to be comfortable with risk. Thankfully we both have the spirit. Some people get it and some don’t.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">How’s the café going?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>It is going great. It’s a real fulfillment of a dream. As special as R&D is as a store, a piece of the experience was missing because so many people went there wanting to stay, wanting to bring their friends and family and linger. We knew it had to be a space that would be as welcoming to the babies, the hipsters, the altacockers [the old-timers] and three generations sitting down at the same time. People are coming to the café to celebrate their weddings, anniversaries and family reunions.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">"We want the customers to feel like they’re a part of our family. We’re a very important part of people’s lives, maybe because we provide food for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, shivas, all these stages of life."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What were some of the little things you changed?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>We’ve made a lot of changes to modernize R&D, but the test for whether a change has been successful is if nobody notices. When I came on board a few years after Josh, we were still taking orders with a pen and paper. We now have a fully integrated point-of-sale system and web orders are integrated with store orders. Most customers don’t notice because they’re still talking to a person on the phone and it’s probably the same person who took their order three months ago. There’s still this very human element.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">Do you have any good stories about regulars?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>So many! First of all we joke that if you’ve been coming for less than 20 years, you’re a new customer. One customer who had been introduced to the store by her husband used to come every Friday. She was a regular for 30 years, and José was the only person who would slice for her—they had this over-the-counter love affair going on. Then she started battling cancer: She couldn’t come in, but we would deliver to her. When she passed away, her daughter called and said, “My mother wrote a list of people she wanted to be informed that she’d passed away, and Russ and Daughters was one of them.” Things like that happen all the time. People bring in their girlfriends and want to introduce them to the guys across the counter to make the relationship official. People come in and they tell me about my grandparents or my great-grandparents.</p>

                    <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What is so special about your relationship with the customers?</h3><span class="fc__interview--span">Josh:</span>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">It goes back to the banter and interaction and relationships we have with the people that have come in every week for 60 to 80 years, or maybe just a few years. We want the customers to feel like they’re a part of our family. We’re a very important part of people’s lives, maybe because we provide food for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, shivas, all these stages of life.</p>
                    <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What kind of family rituals and traditions do you have?</h3>
                    <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>The irony of growing up in R&D is that people assume I had these outrageous brunches all the time and our holidays must have been over-the-top, but the reality was that my parents were always working, and when we were old enough, we were working too. One tradition we have is on New Year’s Eve: We close the store at 6 p.m. and—as a family—we open up a tin of caviar, spoon it out on mother-of-pearl spoons and have some champagne. It just reminds ourselves: “Right, this is so delicious.”</p>

                        <p class="p p__desert--flavor">I kind of wore myself out this past weekend with long days and lots of exciting activity. Matzo ball soup has been on my “to do” list for a looooong time, so I thought this was the perfect opportunity.<br><br>
                            I’ll readily admit, I’ve never made matzo ball soup before this week. I read through some fantastic tutorials and myth busters about matzo balls over at Serious Eats, looked through a bazillion matzo ball soup recipes, and then I finally felt confident. I created a hybrid recipe between what was on the package of my matzo meal and the tips given by Serious Eats. They were surprisingly simple to make and the final soup was like a warm hug.<br><br>
                            Never had matzo balls? It’s a simple dough made of cracker meal, eggs, fat, and a little water or broth. They’re steamed right in a pot of soup where they soak the soup’s delicious flavor. Like most cultural dishes, there are many variations of matzo ball soup and each chef has their own spin or secret touch. If you’re a matzo master, feel free to share your favorite tips and secrets in the comments below. We can all learn from each other!</p>

Add the matzo meal, salt, baking powder, and a little freshly cracked pepper to the eggs and oil. Stir until well combined. Finally, add 3 Tbsp water and stir until smooth again. Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the matzo meal time to absorb the moisture.
                            After the chicken soup has simmered, carefully remove the chicken breast and shred it with a fork. Return the shredded chicken to the soup. Taste the broth and adjust the salt if needed.<br><br>
                            Once the matzo ball mix has refrigerated and stiffened up, begin to form it into ping pong sized balls. Drop the balls into the simmering soup as they are formed, returning the lid to the pot after each one. Once all the matzo balls are in the soup, let them simmer for 20 minutes without removing the lid. Make sure the soup is gently simmering the entire time.
                            Add a couple sprigs of fresh dill just before serving.</p>

                <div class="test-shape--ff">
                    <div class="ff__circle--test"></div>
                    <p class="p p__ff-bodyText">“That must have been some salty cheese!” laughs Lisa Jacobs of Jacobs Creamery in Centralia, upon learning the legend of Judith. Despite her Jewish upbringing, she hadn’t heard this bit of holiday lore and was excited to learn of another intersection of her religion and profession.</p>
                    <p class="p p__ff-bodyText">Even before learning of cheese’s potential as a holiday food, Jacobs has seen how her own religious practices integrate with her business. The self-described “world’s only Irish-Jewish cheesemaker” lives far from the small, very tight Jewish community in Dublin, where she grew up. At age 6, she moved with her family to the United States and transferred to a Jewish day school in California. “Ethics were part of classes; we were taught about integrating Torah into everyday life.” These days, she’s not sure how many other Jews live nearby, and there’s no synagogue to attend. But, she says, “I always resonated with principles more: how to be a good person.”</p>
                </div>
                <p class="p p__ff-bodyText">Jacobs Creamery opened in 2006, after Jacobs had dropped out of law school and was using her free time to catch up on reading, when inspiration to become a cheesemaker struck. “I was reading a book about a grandmother passing on the family cheese recipe to a new generation in the Alps, and immediately went online at three in the morning and signed up for a cheesemaking class on the East Coast.” Armed with just her short class and the desire to break up with her boyfriend, Jacobs marched in to get a license to make cheese. Turns out she needed a cheese vat, an approved food-processing area, and pasteurizing equipment. She had $100 and was in no position to purchase a $38,000 cheese vat.</p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="p p__ff-bodyText">Jacobs is not one to shy away from a challenge. She quickly found a local facility to rent time in and a farmer from whom to purchase milk. “I had never been on a dairy farm,” she says. The homemade mozzarella she brought with her to a meeting with a farmers market manager did the trick in convincing people she would be capable of operating a full-scale cheese operation.</p>
                    <p class="p p__ff-bodyText">Jacobs recently created a custom cheese for her sister’s marriage to an Italian man by the name of Gabrielli. The cheese is a nutty, semisoft Italian style with floral and vanilla notes. Most of Jacobs’ cheeses can be found at Portland-area farmers markets and local PCC Natural Markets.</p>
                    <p class="p p__ff-bodyText">“I like making people happy,” Jacobs says. “I get that feeling of delight when people tell me they served my cheese.”</p>

                            <p>As a New Yorker, I (used to) believe there are but two types of bagels: those found in New York, and total, complete, abhorable garbage.Maybe it's the water! Maybe it's the tradition! Maybe it's just a misguided sense of East Coast urban superiority! (It's probably a mix of all three).But as I get older -- and my horizons expand along with my waistline -- I've realized the rest of our fair nation does indeed have quality bagel options… as long as you know where to look. And if you don't know where to look, look here, at one of these 12 spots. While some of these bagel shops do an admirable job of mimicking the "New York" style, others try (and succeed!) at blazing their own, distinct, breaded path to breakfast food glory.;And while this list may represent the best of the best, it only proves that great bagels don't depend on water, tradition, or location. All that matters is that bagel makers have passion, use quality ingredients, and actually care about the product they produce.Oh, and they have to have holes.If they didn't, they'd just be rolls with fancy toppings.</p>

This family-run business, has been slinging homemade bagels since 1987, with every standard you'd find in a classic New York shop, mixed with West Coast influences (try their cheddar jalapeno, if you get the chance).<br>&emsp;By 6AM, Bagel Brokers makes upwards of 2,500 bagels. By mid-afternoon, they are usually sold out. You can thank Bagel Brokers for blowing the diets of thousands of potential actors/models for three decades. Probably.</p>

You won't find toppings here. They just started accepting credit cards this year. Hell, they won't even slice their bagels for you.<br>&emsp;NY native Terry Skolnick founded Bialy's in 1966, after moving to Cleveland, finding a Jewish name in a phonebook, and asking them the best place to open a bagel shop in Cleveland (yes, seriously). Since then Bialy's has become the bagel destination in Northeast Ohio. They city might have lost LeBron (again), but they'll always have Bialy's.</p>

In 2010, NJ-native Scott Campanozzi opened a bagel shop in the middle of Texas, complete with kettle-boiled bagels, breakfast sandwiches, Nova lox, and even Bronx-sourced Black and White cookies -- if you prefer your morning carbs to come partnered with even more carbs. It's the most New York thing about Austin… aside from never being able to find a cab when you really need it. Trust me: that's a bona fide compliment. Well, at least the first part.</p>

Still, these hand-rolled, kettle-boiled bagels can stand hole-to-hole (sorry) with any in the country. But BB's big distinction is their homemade, hand-whipped cream cheese, which "Some say it looks so pretty, like Gelato!" (their words, not mine) and come in flavors from "Horseradish Bacon," to "Kit Kat." They also have regular cream cheese, if that's more your speed. Boring.</p>

Is it a Draper-esque marketing stunt worthy of the advertising Gods? Maybe. But that doesn't change the fact that their gourmet bagels look, feel, and -- most importantly -- taste like they came straight out of Flatbush. Factor in bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches that taste equally New Yorkian, a corn beef bagel sandwich thicker than the line at Space Mountain, and you've got a breakfast joint that doesn't need really gimmicks to get people in the door. Quality bagels will draw the masses. Even in Florida.</p>

And these bagels just so happen to be the best of their kind in all of the Midwest. Their crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside bagels, baked fresh in-house since the bakery opened in the 1950s, commonly top lists like this. And it's hard to argue with Kauffman's pedigree. With any baked goods, and certainly bagels. Add some legit corn beef to your order, and you've got the best two things about New York, right in suburban Illinois.</p>

They set out, three years ago, to prove Arizona could indeed have a quality bagel spot. And I think, thus far, they've demolished that goal.</p>

Alongside classic flavors like sesame and poppy are idiosyncrasies that embrace the shops roots in Montreal and Vermont. In the first case, a Montreal steak-seasoning, and in the latter, a Maple Syrup-flavored. Oh wait, that's the one thing Vermonters love more than anything else.</p>

It is, however, unique in Portland, as they actually do manage to make some truly amazing in the confines of the Pacific Northwest. They don't have any big secret: they hand-roll their bagels every morning, use only the best, freshest, locally sourced ingredients, and copiously coat their goods with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and other traditional bagel accoutrements inside their diminutive shop -- which is really more of a cart. But, they do take their credentials to the next level with their (multilevel) lunch sandwiches. Damian Lillard himself could hardly dunk over one.</p>

And -- despite being untraditional -- they have a selection of bagel-ready jams to schmear on your bagel of choice. It's a serious name, for a serious bagel joint.</p>

                    <p class="p">Making guests feel comfortable is my primary goal at any dinner party I host. On Shabbat, that can be a little tricky. On top of the typical considerations — things like food allergies and guest compatibility — there is just a lot of stuff that happens during Shabbat dinner that can be confusing to people who have not experienced it before.<br><br>Of course, every Shabbat dinner is a little different. Some folks are very traditional and follow all the rules; others, not so much. Meanwhile, each family develops its own customs and special touches. If you are heading to your first Shabbat dinner, don't be afraid to ask questions about what is going on! Your hosts will be thrilled to fill you in. But if you want a little leg up before you go, check out this pocket guide for a crash course in Shabbat dinner 101.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4">What is Shabbat Dinner?</h4>
                    <p class="p">Shabbat arrives every Friday at sunset and continues through the following day until the sun sets completely. It commemorates the seventh day of Biblical creation, when the Torah says God stopped to rest and appreciate his creation.<br><br>Traditionally, Jews mirror this divine day of rest by abstaining from cooking, driving, spending money, checking their Instagram feeds, and engaging in the 39 types of broadly defined "creative work" identified in the Torah. Instead, they spend time together, sing, learn, reflect, and eat celebratory meals — the first of which is Shabbat dinner!</p>

                    <h4 class="h4">What to Expect at Shabbat Dinner</h4>
                    <p class="p">The Friday night meal is the heart of the Shabbat celebration, and lots of hosts go out of their way to create a meal that feels distinct and special from the rest of the week. Most likely the candles, which are typically lit and blessed right at sunset when the holiday begins, will already be burning brightly. But some families begin their dinner by lighting candles and saying the blessing together.<br><br>Before the dinner begins, your hosts might invite people to join in a few songs and blessings over the wine and challah — a preamble that sets the festive mood. Depending on how religious your hosts are, this could last anywhere from five to 15 minutes. In more observant homes, people ritually wash their hands just before blessing and eating the challah. As a guest, you will be invited to do this too, but are not obligated, of course!</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="fc__p--body"><strong>Tip:</strong> People tend to refrain from speaking after hand-washing until the blessing is said and the challah is passed around the table. So if someone just nods and half-smiles but doesn't answer when you ask, "So, what do you do?" right after they wash their hands, don't take it personally!</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="p">During dinner, the mood will be like any other dinner party: lots of talking, laughing, passing around food, and contented pats of the belly. Some families take a break from eating between the main meal and dessert to sing. As the evening winds down, dinner might just end like any other. But many families will pass out small booklets called benschers that hold the text to Birkat Hamazon — a grace said after the meal is over — and sing that together as well.</p>

                    <h4 class="h4"><em>Some Helpful Shabbat Terms</em></h4>
                    <ul class="ul ul__terms">
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Shabbat/Shabbos:</strong> These terms mean the same thing (the Sabbath), and are used interchangeably. The first is the Hebrew pronunciation, and the latter is Yiddish.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Kipah:</strong> This is the traditional head covering, also called a yarmulke, worn by men, and in some households, women. Less observant Jews don't wear them at all, but your hosts might ask that you wear one during the meal. Don't worry about trying to find one to bring with you, though — they will almost certainly have a drawer of extras you can choose from.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Shalom Aleichem:</strong> This is a song typically sung just before the blessings over wine and challah are said. It welcomes the "angels" of Shabbat to the table. It has a lovely tune, and sets a beautiful tone for the meal.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Kiddush:</strong> This is the blessing said over the wine.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Motzi:</strong> This is the blessing said over the challah (ceremonial braided bread).</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Bensching/Birkat Hamazon:</strong> It is a Jewish custom to bless food both before eating it, when you are hungry, and after, when you are satisfied. This blessing of thanks is said after the meal is over.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="h4">What to Bring (and What Not to Bring!)</h4>
                    <p class="p">In most cases, unless the host specifically asks you to bring something, you do not need to arrive with anything aside from a good appetite, curiosity, and conversation. But for those of us who don't like to show up empty-handed, here are a few pointers.</p>
                    <ul class="ul ul__terms">
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DO</strong> bring wine or chocolate.An extra bottle of wine goes a long way, and nothing says thanks for having me! like chocolate. In either case, find out in advance if your hosts keep kosher. If they do, make sure to look for a kosher certification symbol on any food or drink you bring.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DON'T</strong> bring home-cooked food. For non-kosher keepers, home-cooked food might be a completely welcome addition, but be sure to clear whatever you are bringing with your host in advance to make sure it goes with what they are serving. If your kitchen is not kosher, it is best to avoid bringing cooked food into a kosher home. Your hosts will certainly appreciate the gesture, but might not be able to serve the food on their dishes. It is awkward for you and potentially embarrassing for them — better to just avoid the whole scenario!</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DO</strong> bring a house gift. A pretty set of dish towels or hand soaps, or a delicious scented candle are all lovely.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DON'T</strong> bring flowers. Fresh flowers are usually a go-to house gift, but on Shabbat, religiously observant people cannot put the flowers in water. (It violates one of the 39 categories of prohibited work on Shabbat.) If you do bring flowers, make sure to bring them in a vase that already has water in it, or bring a potted plant.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DO</strong> bring your singing voice. Singing is central to many Shabbat dinners, and every singer is welcome. (Yes, even the tone-deaf ones!) Don't worry if you don't know the words — many of the songs sung on Shabbat are wordless melodies you'll pick up quickly.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DON'T</strong> bring your cellphone. Texting or taking a call is rude during any dinner party, but using cell phones is prohibited during Shabbat. So leave your phone at home, or stashed discreetly in your purse. I promise you can live without Instagram for two hours — you might even enjoy the opportunity to go analogue for an evening! If you absolutely have to make a call, excuse yourself to the bathroom or backyard.</li>

This week features Laura Cowan, a <a href="http://www.lauracowan.com/" target="_blank">contemporary Judaica designer and Jewish artist</a>.</h3>
                <div class="pantry__interview">
                    <p class="interview__q">Tell us a bit about yourself</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I was born Manchester, England and grew up with my parents and two older brothers. My grandparents were very involved in the shul so we always kept kosher at home, something that is very important to me to pass on to my children. My eldest child is stricter than me!</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">My favorite subject at school was always Art and I knew one day I’d make a career out of it. I studied BA Hons Jewelry and Silversmithing at Sir John Cass at London Guildhall University. It was a perfect course for me because it combined design, silversmithing, art history and business studies. After my degree, I moved to Tel Aviv. I studied Hebrew in the morning, and in the afternoon I took an apprenticeship with a jeweler in Old Jaffa.</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">After a year, I was ready to move on and started looking at the rocket shaped jewelry that I had produced for my degree exhibition and realized they would make perfect mezuzahs. I set up a small studio on my balcony and experimented with copper, brass, and silver and produced various looks with different colored patinas.</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I became vegetarian over 30 years ago for ideological reasons – over the years I have gone through phases of being less strict and eating fish and at the moment I am trying to reduce dairy, so I have started by swapping regular milk for almond milk</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I have 3 kids aged 6, 9 and 12, who are all fussy eaters and don’t like any of the same foods so almost every meal I’d make three dishes for them – so I keep it super simple – baked potatoes with cream cheese, mashed avocado and Israeli salad, healthy pancakes (with whole wheat flour, coconut oil, almond butter and chia seeds) or spaghetti with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.</p>
                    <p class="interview__q">How do you typically feel, emotionally, when you open your kitchen pantry?</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">Pretty relaxed really, anything that isn’t used on a regular basis I throw out as I believe the key to organization is to minimize.</p>
                    <p class="interview__q">What’s your process for organizing your food pantry?</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I studied home economics at school and we learned to keep items that you use together only one or two steps away from each other. I designed my kitchen galley style so it’s really easy to grab whatever I need quickly. Spices are in a pull out drawer next to the stove – I label the tops of the lids so I can see everything at a glance. Sweet or semi-junk food is on a high shelf so I think twice about taking something.</p>
                    <p class="interview__q interview__mainq">What’s inside of your pantry right now?</p>
                    <div class="pantry__item">

                        <p class="interview__a interview__a--title"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jcnSOr" target="_blank">Star Anise</a></p>
                        <p class="interview__a">This 8-pointed star-shaped spice is so beautiful to look at! It looks stunning in cocktails, and tastes especially good in a white wine sangria. I buy them from a spice stall in <a href="http://en.shuktlv.co.il/category/carmel-market" target="_blank">Carmel market</a>.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a">My kids love this and although it contains a lot of sugar, it’s a great source of calcium. It also keeps for months. I buy it from <a href="http://saronamarket.co.il/en/%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%94" target="_blank">The Halva Kingdom in Sarona Market</a>.

                        <p class="interview__a">Lots of tins of tomatoes. I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2jX5TzA" target="_blank">this Italian brand</a> – they seem to taste much sweeter than other brands. I use these to make Shakshuka – a North African dish of onion, garlic, tomatoes, red peppers and lots of cumin and black cracked pepper – cooked and eaten in the same iron skillet with an egg poached directly in it. I like it sprinkled with lots of coriander and we eat it with a ripped-up loaf of the simplest bread.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a">I use <a href="http://www.tnuvausa.com/fresh-from-the-dairy/try-something-fresh/salted-butter" target="_blank">this kosher Israeli brand</a>. I love using this for cooking as well as baking, as I think the flavor is much better than unsalted. You might think of it as a regular staple but lately, in Israel, it’s been off the shelves due to a milk shortage – the farms don’t have enough for their milk sales so they are holding back on butter manufacture. My butter-loving friends and I update each other if we see it being sold anywhere.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a">In Israel everyone has a specific favourite. Mine are the small Souri (named after a Lebanese city) green cracked olives with pickled lemon. My favourite Israeli brand is called <a href="http://zetaoliveoil.co.il/product/%D7%96%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A2-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A9/" target="_blank">Zita</a>.
