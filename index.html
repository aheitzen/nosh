                <p class="h3 h3__attr">By Gail O'Hara</p>
                <p class="fc__p--body">Family. Quality. Service. History. Soul. New York. Community. Few businesses embody these qualities as perfectly as the 101-year-old Russ and Daughters. We speak to the fourth generation running the institution.</p>
                <p class="fc__p--body">When Joel Russ emigrated from Austria-Hungary to the United States in 1907, he kicked off his career by selling strings of mushrooms that he carried on his shoulders. After running his business out of a pushcart and then a horse and wagon, Joel was able to open up his first brick-and-mortar “appetizing” shop in 1914 (first on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side, and later at the current location on East Houston Street in 1920).</p>
                <div class="test-shape">
                    <img class="circle" src="images/r&d-1.png">
                    <p class="fc__p--body">During this time he and his wife, Bella, had three daughters: Hattie, Anne and Ida. Hattie began learning the business in 1924 and her sisters came in to help shortly after. The shop was renamed “Russ and Daughters” in 1933, which caused quite a ruckus in the neighborhood—women just didn’t run businesses in those days. Sadly, Joel passed away in 1961, and later Anne’s son Mark Russ Federman took over the shop in 1978. <br>
                        <p class="fc__p--body">More recently, Joel’s great-grandchildren Joshua Russ Tupper and Niki Russ Federman (pictured) have been handed the torch to run, expand and modernize the store. R&D has been through a lot: During the Depression, Joel had to decide whether to sell the business or the family home, and he opted to sell the house, betting that saving the business would keep the family afloat. And now, 101 years later, Russ and Daughters is still going strong.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="fc__p--body">R&D sells forshpayz, which means the foods you eat with bagels, such as smoked or cured fish, homemade salads and cream cheese. In 2014, the year that the original store celebrated 100 years in business, Niki and Joshua decided to open a new sit-down café on Orchard Street, very close to their great-grandfather’s original space (they also plan to open a shop/café in the Jewish Museum this spring). R&D has a loyal following that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal and Justice Ginsburg, and was also the subject of a documentary called The Sturgeon Queens in 2014.</p>
                <p class="fc__p--body">We interviewed cousins/fourth-generation owners Niki and Joshua about small-business longevity, family traditions and smoked fish.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What kind of experiences did you have in the shop as a kid?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Josh: </span>We’d go behind the candy counter, fill our pockets and then go to my grandmother’s house and have a big Russ and Daughters spread for lunch. My cousin and I would take bagels, put cream cheese on them and then proceed to put every single fish on top. My grandmother would yell at us: “How are you going to taste everything with salmon and sable and sturgeon and herring all on the same bagel?!”</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">“My mother wrote a list of people she wanted to be informed that she’d passed away, and Russ and Daughters was one of them.” Things like that happen all the time.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">Do you know of any other stores with “and Daughters” in the name?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>As far as we know, it was the first business in this country with “and Daughters,” and it’s still rare. You mostly see “and Sons,” “and Brothers,” “and Cousins.” I’d like to think my great-grandfather was this pioneering feminist making a political statement, but the sad truth is that he didn’t have any sons: He only had daughters. He also understood that it sounded like a good name, and maybe it wasn’t so bad if he stirred up a bit of controversy, which he did.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What are the challenges of running a family business?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>R&D is in a very rare minority of fourth-generation businesses. I’ve heard that only 1 percent of family businesses ever make it to a fourth generation. I joke that the secret to running a successful family business is to not have too much family involved. But there’s a benefit because there’s a level of trust there, which is hard to come by: Josh and I can cover for each other. In some family businesses there’s pressure or expectation on certain family members that this is something you have to do with your life, and that’s unfair. At some point people will realize that they’re not living the life they wanted. We have a very individualistic society and you’re supposed to do your own thing, not what your parents did. I had that prejudice for a long time, but traveling to Asia and Europe where I saw family businesses that have been going for ten generations made me appreciate the beauty of being part of a legacy. A family business can’t be a birthright. I didn’t inherit anything—I had to work hard and prove I was capable of doing this.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What has the family business taught you about longevity?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>The importance of taking the long view. We feel more like stewards who are entrusted with preserving and growing R&D so we’ll be able to hand it off to the next generation—of our family and our customers. We’re making decisions that will ensure the business will be around for another 100 years. Our longevity is due to quality. R&D has continuously been a part of New York history and a part of people’s lives for so long that it has become a geographic and emotional reference point. It helps people make sense of their lives. The second you step into R&D, you’re transported. It conjures up a memory: Where you went as a kid or eating with your grandparents or when you lived in New York. A guy walked in the door not too long ago and we kept saying, “Can we help you?” And he just stood there and said, “Can I just stand here for a second? I’m just so happy that you’re still here.” It’s more than just a store—it feels like a community center.</p>
                <img class="fc__middleImg" src="images/r&d-4.png">
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">Do entrepreneurial qualities run in your family?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Josh: </span> It comes naturally to me. Even with inheriting a 100-year-old business, you need to grow the business and see the future. We determined that it was time to open a sit-down restaurant. From the family’s perspective, it has always just been a store, so there was pushback. You have to be comfortable with risk. Thankfully we both have the spirit. Some people get it and some don’t.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">How’s the café going?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>It is going great. It’s a real fulfillment of a dream. As special as R&D is as a store, a piece of the experience was missing because so many people went there wanting to stay, wanting to bring their friends and family and linger. We knew it had to be a space that would be as welcoming to the babies, the hipsters, the altacockers [the old-timers] and three generations sitting down at the same time. People are coming to the café to celebrate their weddings, anniversaries and family reunions.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">"We want the customers to feel like they’re a part of our family. We’re a very important part of people’s lives, maybe because we provide food for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, shivas, all these stages of life."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What were some of the little things you changed?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>We’ve made a lot of changes to modernize R&D, but the test for whether a change has been successful is if nobody notices. When I came on board a few years after Josh, we were still taking orders with a pen and paper. We now have a fully integrated point-of-sale system and web orders are integrated with store orders. Most customers don’t notice because they’re still talking to a person on the phone and it’s probably the same person who took their order three months ago. There’s still this very human element.</p>
                <h3 class="fc__interview--header">Do you have any good stories about regulars?</h3>
                <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>So many! First of all we joke that if you’ve been coming for less than 20 years, you’re a new customer. One customer who had been introduced to the store by her husband used to come every Friday. She was a regular for 30 years, and José was the only person who would slice for her—they had this over-the-counter love affair going on. Then she started battling cancer: She couldn’t come in, but we would deliver to her. When she passed away, her daughter called and said, “My mother wrote a list of people she wanted to be informed that she’d passed away, and Russ and Daughters was one of them.” Things like that happen all the time. People bring in their girlfriends and want to introduce them to the guys across the counter to make the relationship official. People come in and they tell me about my grandparents or my great-grandparents.</p>
                <div class="test-shape">
                    <img class="rectangle" src="images/r&d-three.png">
                    <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What is so special about your relationship with the customers?</h3><span class="fc__interview--span">Josh:</span>
                    <p class="fc__p--body">It goes back to the banter and interaction and relationships we have with the people that have come in every week for 60 to 80 years, or maybe just a few years. We want the customers to feel like they’re a part of our family. We’re a very important part of people’s lives, maybe because we provide food for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, shivas, all these stages of life.</p>
                    <h3 class="fc__interview--header">What kind of family rituals and traditions do you have?</h3>
                    <p class="fc__p--body"><span class="fc__interview--span">Niki: </span>The irony of growing up in R&D is that people assume I had these outrageous brunches all the time and our holidays must have been over-the-top, but the reality was that my parents were always working, and when we were old enough, we were working too. One tradition we have is on New Year’s Eve: We close the store at 6 p.m. and—as a family—we open up a tin of caviar, spoon it out on mother-of-pearl spoons and have some champagne. It just reminds ourselves: “Right, this is so delicious.”</p>

                        <p class="p p__desert--flavor">I kind of wore myself out this past weekend with long days and lots of exciting activity. Matzo ball soup has been on my “to do” list for a looooong time, so I thought this was the perfect opportunity.<br><br>
                            I’ll readily admit, I’ve never made matzo ball soup before this week. I read through some fantastic tutorials and myth busters about matzo balls over at Serious Eats, looked through a bazillion matzo ball soup recipes, and then I finally felt confident. I created a hybrid recipe between what was on the package of my matzo meal and the tips given by Serious Eats. They were surprisingly simple to make and the final soup was like a warm hug.<br><br>
                            Never had matzo balls? It’s a simple dough made of cracker meal, eggs, fat, and a little water or broth. They’re steamed right in a pot of soup where they soak the soup’s delicious flavor. Like most cultural dishes, there are many variations of matzo ball soup and each chef has their own spin or secret touch. If you’re a matzo master, feel free to share your favorite tips and secrets in the comments below. We can all learn from each other!</p>

                        <hr class="hr hr__desert-matzo">
                        <p class="p p__matzo--dirrections">Mince the garlic and dice the onion, celery, and carrots. Sauté the garlic, onion, celery, and carrots with the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes).<br><br>Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, 2 cups water, some freshly cracked pepper, and one or two sprigs of dill to the pot. Place a lid on the pot and let it come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.<br><br>
                            While the soup is simmering, mix the matzo ball dough. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and vegetable oil. Add the matzo meal, salt, baking powder, and a little freshly cracked pepper to the eggs and oil. Stir until well combined. Finally, add 3 Tbsp water and stir until smooth again. Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the matzo meal time to absorb the moisture.
                            After the chicken soup has simmered, carefully remove the chicken breast and shred it with a fork. Return the shredded chicken to the soup. Taste the broth and adjust the salt if needed.<br><br>
                            Once the matzo ball mix has refrigerated and stiffened up, begin to form it into ping pong sized balls. Drop the balls into the simmering soup as they are formed, returning the lid to the pot after each one. Once all the matzo balls are in the soup, let them simmer for 20 minutes without removing the lid. Make sure the soup is gently simmering the entire time.
                            Add a couple sprigs of fresh dill just before serving.</p>

                <img class="img--hero" src="../images/guide1.jpg" alt="guide1.jpg" width="500px">
                <h3 class="h3__subtitle">By Leah Koenig</h3>
                <div class="shabbat__guide">
                    <p class="p--guide">Making guests feel comfortable is my primary goal at any dinner party I host. On Shabbat, that can be a little tricky. On top of the typical considerations — things like food allergies and guest compatibility — there is just a lot of stuff that happens during Shabbat dinner that can be confusing to people who have not experienced it before.<br><br>Of course, every Shabbat dinner is a little different. Some folks are very traditional and follow all the rules; others, not so much. Meanwhile, each family develops its own customs and special touches. If you are heading to your first Shabbat dinner, don't be afraid to ask questions about what is going on! Your hosts will be thrilled to fill you in. But if you want a little leg up before you go, check out this pocket guide for a crash course in Shabbat dinner 101.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4--guide">What is Shabbat Dinner?</h4>
                    <p class="p--guide">Shabbat arrives every Friday at sunset and continues through the following day until the sun sets completely. It commemorates the seventh day of Biblical creation, when the Torah says God stopped to rest and appreciate his creation.<br><br>Traditionally, Jews mirror this divine day of rest by abstaining from cooking, driving, spending money, checking their Instagram feeds, and engaging in the 39 types of broadly defined "creative work" identified in the Torah. Instead, they spend time together, sing, learn, reflect, and eat celebratory meals — the first of which is Shabbat dinner!</p>
                    <h4 class="h4--guide">What to Expect at Shabbat Dinner</h4>
                    <p class="p--guide">The Friday night meal is the heart of the Shabbat celebration, and lots of hosts go out of their way to create a meal that feels distinct and special from the rest of the week. Most likely the candles, which are typically lit and blessed right at sunset when the holiday begins, will already be burning brightly. But some families begin their dinner by lighting candles and saying the blessing together.<br><br>Before the dinner begins, your hosts might invite people to join in a few songs and blessings over the wine and challah — a preamble that sets the festive mood. Depending on how religious your hosts are, this could last anywhere from five to 15 minutes. In more observant homes, people ritually wash their hands just before blessing and eating the challah. As a guest, you will be invited to do this too, but are not obligated, of course!</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="fc__p--body"><strong>Tip:</strong> People tend to refrain from speaking after hand-washing until the blessing is said and the challah is passed around the table. So if someone just nods and half-smiles but doesn't answer when you ask, "So, what do you do?" right after they wash their hands, don't take it personally!</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="p--guide">During dinner, the mood will be like any other dinner party: lots of talking, laughing, passing around food, and contented pats of the belly. Some families take a break from eating between the main meal and dessert to sing. As the evening winds down, dinner might just end like any other. But many families will pass out small booklets called benschers that hold the text to Birkat Hamazon — a grace said after the meal is over — and sing that together as well.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4--guide"><em>Some Helpful Shabbat Terms</em></h4>
                    <ul class="ul ul__terms">
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Shabbat/Shabbos:</strong> These terms mean the same thing (the Sabbath), and are used interchangeably. The first is the Hebrew pronunciation, and the latter is Yiddish.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Kipah:</strong> This is the traditional head covering, also called a yarmulke, worn by men, and in some households, women. Less observant Jews don't wear them at all, but your hosts might ask that you wear one during the meal. Don't worry about trying to find one to bring with you, though — they will almost certainly have a drawer of extras you can choose from.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>Shalom Aleichem:</strong> This is a song typically sung just before the blessings over wine and challah are said. It welcomes the "angels" of Shabbat to the table. It has a lovely tune, and sets a beautiful tone for the meal.</li>

                    <h4 class="h4--guide">What to Bring (and What Not to Bring!)</h4>
                    <p class="p--guide">In most cases, unless the host specifically asks you to bring something, you do not need to arrive with anything aside from a good appetite, curiosity, and conversation. But for those of us who don't like to show up empty-handed, here are a few pointers.</p>
                    <ul class="ul ul__terms">
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DO</strong> bring wine or chocolate.An extra bottle of wine goes a long way, and nothing says thanks for having me! like chocolate. In either case, find out in advance if your hosts keep kosher. If they do, make sure to look for a kosher certification symbol on any food or drink you bring.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DON'T</strong> bring home-cooked food. For non-kosher keepers, home-cooked food might be a completely welcome addition, but be sure to clear whatever you are bringing with your host in advance to make sure it goes with what they are serving. If your kitchen is not kosher, it is best to avoid bringing cooked food into a kosher home. Your hosts will certainly appreciate the gesture, but might not be able to serve the food on their dishes. It is awkward for you and potentially embarrassing for them — better to just avoid the whole scenario!</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DO</strong> bring a house gift. A pretty set of dish towels or hand soaps, or a delicious scented candle are all lovely.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DON'T</strong> bring flowers. Fresh flowers are usually a go-to house gift, but on Shabbat, religiously observant people cannot put the flowers in water. (It violates one of the 39 categories of prohibited work on Shabbat.) If you do bring flowers, make sure to bring them in a vase that already has water in it, or bring a potted plant.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DO</strong> bring your singing voice. Singing is central to many Shabbat dinners, and every singer is welcome. (Yes, even the tone-deaf ones!) Don't worry if you don't know the words — many of the songs sung on Shabbat are wordless melodies you'll pick up quickly.</li>
                        <li class="li li__terms"><strong>DON'T</strong> bring your cellphone. Texting or taking a call is rude during any dinner party, but using cell phones is prohibited during Shabbat. So leave your phone at home, or stashed discreetly in your purse. I promise you can live without Instagram for two hours — you might even enjoy the opportunity to go analogue for an evening! If you absolutely have to make a call, excuse yourself to the bathroom or backyard.</li>

                <h3 class="h3__subtitle">What’s in Your Pantry? is a recurring feature where we ask women to tell us more about their food and eating habits by opening up their kitchen pantries to us. This week features Laura Cowan, a <a href="http://www.lauracowan.com/" target="_blank">contemporary Judaica designer and Jewish artist</a>.</h3>
                <div class="pantry__interview">
                    <p class="interview__q">Tell us a bit about yourself</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I was born Manchester, England and grew up with my parents and two older brothers. My grandparents were very involved in the shul so we always kept kosher at home, something that is very important to me to pass on to my children. My eldest child is stricter than me!</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">My favorite subject at school was always Art and I knew one day I’d make a career out of it. I studied BA Hons Jewelry and Silversmithing at Sir John Cass at London Guildhall University. It was a perfect course for me because it combined design, silversmithing, art history and business studies. After my degree, I moved to Tel Aviv. I studied Hebrew in the morning, and in the afternoon I took an apprenticeship with a jeweler in Old Jaffa.</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">After a year, I was ready to move on and started looking at the rocket shaped jewelry that I had produced for my degree exhibition and realized they would make perfect mezuzahs. I set up a small studio on my balcony and experimented with copper, brass, and silver and produced various looks with different colored patinas.</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I became vegetarian over 30 years ago for ideological reasons – over the years I have gone through phases of being less strict and eating fish and at the moment I am trying to reduce dairy, so I have started by swapping regular milk for almond milk</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I have 3 kids aged 6, 9 and 12, who are all fussy eaters and don’t like any of the same foods so almost every meal I’d make three dishes for them – so I keep it super simple – baked potatoes with cream cheese, mashed avocado and Israeli salad, healthy pancakes (with whole wheat flour, coconut oil, almond butter and chia seeds) or spaghetti with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.</p>
                    <p class="interview__q">How do you typically feel, emotionally, when you open your kitchen pantry?</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">Pretty relaxed really, anything that isn’t used on a regular basis I throw out as I believe the key to organization is to minimize.</p>
                    <p class="interview__q">What’s your process for organizing your food pantry?</p>
                    <p class="interview__a">I studied home economics at school and we learned to keep items that you use together only one or two steps away from each other. I designed my kitchen galley style so it’s really easy to grab whatever I need quickly. Spices are in a pull out drawer next to the stove – I label the tops of the lids so I can see everything at a glance. Sweet or semi-junk food is on a high shelf so I think twice about taking something.</p>
                    <p class="interview__q interview__mainq">What’s inside of your pantry right now?</p>

                        <p class="interview__a interview__a--title"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jcnSOr" target="_blank">Star Anise</a></p>
                        <p class="interview__a">This 8-pointed star-shaped spice is so beautiful to look at! It looks stunning in cocktails, and tastes especially good in a white wine sangria. I buy them from a spice stall in <a href="http://en.shuktlv.co.il/category/carmel-market" target="_blank">Carmel market</a>.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a interview__a--title"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jcl1VY" target="_blank">Halva</a></p>
                        <p class="interview__a">My kids love this and although it contains a lot of sugar, it’s a great source of calcium. It also keeps for months. I buy it from <a href="http://saronamarket.co.il/en/%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%94" target="_blank">The Halva Kingdom in Sarona Market</a>. My kids love the chocolate version and my favorite is pistachio.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a interview__a--title">Tomatoes</p>
                        <p class="interview__a">Lots of tins of tomatoes. I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2jX5TzA" target="_blank">this Italian brand</a> – they seem to taste much sweeter than other brands. I use these to make Shakshuka – a North African dish of onion, garlic, tomatoes, red peppers and lots of cumin and black cracked pepper – cooked and eaten in the same iron skillet with an egg poached directly in it. I like it sprinkled with lots of coriander and we eat it with a ripped-up loaf of the simplest bread.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a interview__a--title">Local Salted Butter</p>
                        <p class="interview__a">I use <a href="http://www.tnuvausa.com/fresh-from-the-dairy/try-something-fresh/salted-butter" target="_blank">this kosher Israeli brand</a>. I love using this for cooking as well as baking, as I think the flavor is much better than unsalted. You might think of it as a regular staple but lately, in Israel, it’s been off the shelves due to a milk shortage – the farms don’t have enough for their milk sales so they are holding back on butter manufacture. My butter-loving friends and I update each other if we see it being sold anywhere.</p>

                        <p class="interview__a interview__a--title">Olives</p>
                        <p class="interview__a">In Israel everyone has a specific favourite. Mine are the small Souri (named after a Lebanese city) green cracked olives with pickled lemon. My favourite Israeli brand is called <a href="http://zetaoliveoil.co.il/product/%D7%96%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A2-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A9/" target="_blank">Zita</a>. I eat these alongside a simple Israeli salad and crackers with cream cheese.</p>
