							<p>&emsp;For any disgruntled New Yorker making a jump to the West Coast, two factors must weigh heavily on their mind: where will I find good pizza, and (perhaps more importantly), where will I find good bagels?<br>&emsp;For the first part of that specific transplant conundrum, Bagel Brokers has stepped in to make sure NY-caliber bagels are available to every kale-juice guzzling aspiring influencer in LA. This family-run business, has been slinging homemade bagels since 1987, with every standard you'd find in a classic New York shop, mixed with West Coast influences (try their cheddar jalapeno, if you get the chance).<br>&emsp;By 6AM, Bagel Brokers makes upwards of 2,500 bagels. By mid-afternoon, they are usually sold out. You can thank Bagel Brokers for blowing the diets of thousands of potential actors/models for three decades. Probably.</p>

						<h3 class="h3 h3__top-ten" id="cleveland-ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</h3>
						<div class="text text__paragraph--container" id="bialy-text">
							<p>&emsp;As if the objective quality of Bialy's New York-style bagels weren't enough to warrant an inclusion (it is), the strict adherence to bare bones, bagel simplicity would be. You won't find toppings here. They just started accepting credit cards this year. Hell, they won't even slice their bagels for you.<br>&emsp;NY native Terry Skolnick founded Bialy's in 1966, after moving to Cleveland, finding a Jewish name in a phonebook, and asking them the best place to open a bagel shop in Cleveland (yes, seriously). Since then Bialy's has become the bagel destination in Northeast Ohio. They city might have lost LeBron (again), but they'll always have Bialy's.</p>

						<div class="text text__paragraph--container" id="wholy-text">
							<p>&emsp;The puntastic Wholy Bagel is yet again the result of a starry-eyed East Coaster, hell-bent on bringing quality bagels to desolate (at least in a bagel sense…) locales. In 2010, NJ-native  Scott Campanozzi opened a bagel shop in the middle of Texas, complete with kettle-boiled bagels, breakfast sandwiches, Nova lox, and even Bronx-sourced Black and White cookies -- if you prefer your morning carbs to come partnered with even more carbs. It's the most New York thing about Austin… aside from never being able to find a cab when you really need it. Trust me: that's a bona fide compliment. Well, at least the first part.</p>

						<div class="text text__paragraph--container" id="bb-text">
							<p>&emsp;Despite being more than 30 miles outside of any major metropolitan area (in this case, the sprawl of Atlanta), BB's has certainly become one of the most iconic bagel shops in the American South -- an area that, admittedly, is not really known for their bagels in the first place. Still, these hand-rolled, kettle-boiled bagels can stand hole-to-hole (sorry) with any in the country. But BB's big distinction is their homemade, hand-whipped cream cheese, which "Some say it looks so pretty, like Gelato!" (their words, not mine) and come in flavors from "Horseradish Bacon," to "Kit Kat." They also have regular cream cheese, if that's more your speed. Boring.</p>

							<p>&emsp;As a New Yorker, I (used to) believe there are but two types of bagels: those found in New York, and total, complete, abhorable garbage.<br>&emsp;Maybe it's the water! Maybe it's the tradition! Maybe it's just a misguided sense of East Coast urban superiority! (It's probably a mix of all three).<br>&emsp;But as I get older -- and my horizons expand along with my waistline -- I've realized the rest of our fair nation does indeed have quality bagel options… as long as you know where to look. And if you don't know where to look, look here, at one of these 12 spots. While some of these bagel shops do an admirable job of mimicking the "New York" style, others try (and succeed!) at blazing their own, distinct, breaded path to breakfast food glory.<br>&emsp;And while this list may represent the best of the best, it only proves that great bagels don't depend on water, tradition, or location. All that matters is that bagel makers have passion, use quality ingredients, and actually care about the product they produce.<br>&emsp;Oh, and they have to have holes.<br>&emsp;If they didn't, they'd just be rolls with fancy toppings.</p>
