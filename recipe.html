                <p class="p p__desert--atr">By Beth Bryne</p>
                <p class="p p__desert--flavor">I kind of wore myself out this past weekend with long days and lots of exciting activity. Matzo ball soup has been on my “to do” list for a looooong time, so I thought this was the perfect opportunity.<br><br>
                I’ll readily admit, I’ve never made matzo ball soup before this week. I read through some fantastic tutorials and myth busters about matzo balls over at Serious Eats, looked through a bazillion matzo ball soup recipes, and then I finally felt confident. I created a hybrid recipe between what was on the package of my matzo meal and the tips given by Serious Eats. They were surprisingly simple to make and the final soup was like a warm hug.<br><br>
                Never had matzo balls? It’s a simple dough made of cracker meal, eggs, fat, and a little water or broth. They’re steamed right in a pot of soup where they soak the soup’s delicious flavor. Like most cultural dishes, there are many variations of matzo ball soup and each chef has their own spin or secret touch. If you’re a matzo master, feel free to share your favorite tips and secrets in the comments below. We can all learn from each other!</p>

                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- 1 Tbsp vegetable or canola oil</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- 2 cloves garlic</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- 1 yellow onion</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- 3 large eggs</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- 3/4 cup matzo meal</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- 6 cups chicken broth</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- Few sprigs fresh dill</li>
                        <li class="li li__recipie--matzo">- Freshly cracked pepper</li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr class="hr hr__desert-matzo">
                    <p class="p p__matzo--dirrections">Mince the garlic and dice the onion, celery, and carrots. Sauté the garlic, onion, celery, and carrots with the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes).<br><br>
                    Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, 2 cups water, some freshly cracked pepper, and one or two sprigs of dill to the pot. Place a lid on the pot and let it come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.<br><br>
                    While the soup is simmering, mix the matzo ball dough. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and vegetable oil. Add the matzo meal, salt, baking powder, and a little freshly cracked pepper to the eggs and oil. Stir until well combined. Finally, add 3 Tbsp water and stir until smooth again. Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the matzo meal time to absorb the moisture.
                    After the chicken soup has simmered, carefully remove the chicken breast and shred it with a fork. Return the shredded chicken to the soup. Taste the broth and adjust the salt if needed.<br><br>
                    Once the matzo ball mix has refrigerated and stiffened up, begin to form it into ping pong sized balls. Drop the balls into the simmering soup as they are formed, returning the lid to the pot after each one. Once all the matzo balls are in the soup, let them simmer for 20 minutes without removing the lid. Make sure the soup is gently simmering the entire time.
                    Add a couple sprigs of fresh dill just before serving.</p>

    							<li class="li li__directions--modal">Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil. Finely grind the biscotti in a food processor. Add the melted butter and process until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom (not the sides) of the prepared pan. Bake until the crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Cool the crust completely on a cooling rack.</li>
    							<li class="li li__directions--modal">Blend the ricotta in a clean food processor until smooth.

Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cheesecake is golden and the center of the cake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour and 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold).</li>
