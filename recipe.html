                <p class="p p__desert--atr">By Beth Bryne</p>
                <p class="p p__desert--flavor">I kind of wore myself out this past weekend with long days and lots of exciting activity. So when I finally made it home to New Orleans, I was feeling tired, achy, and in the need of a warm cozy meal. Matzo ball soup has been on my “to do” list for a looooong time, so I thought this was the perfect opportunity.<br><br>
                I’ll readily admit, I’ve never made matzo ball soup before this week. I read through some fantastic tutorials and myth busters about matzo balls over at Serious Eats, looked through a bazillion matzo ball soup recipes, and then I finally felt confident trying it myself. I created a hybrid recipe between what was on the package of my matzo meal and the tips given by Serious Eats. They were surprisingly simple to make and the final soup was like a big, warm hug. Success!<br><br>
                Never had matzo balls? Well, they’re yet another cultural rendition of dumplings. It’s a simple dough made of cracker (matzo) meal, eggs, fat, and a little water or broth. They’re steamed right in a pot of soup where they soak up all the soup’s delicious flavor as they cook. Like most cultural dishes, there are many variations of matzo ball soup and each chef has their own spin or secret touch. If you’re a matzo master, feel free to share your favorite tips and secrets in the comments below. We can all learn from each other! :)</p>

		<h4 class="h4 h4__deserts">This year, in honor of the first of the High Holy Days, revel in the sweetness of the coming Jewish new year with festive, honey-laced treats that are blissfully sweet and celebratory.For those of you gathering around the table for Rosh Hashana, you know that dipping apples in honey symbolizes the promise of a sweet new year. It's a time-honored combination that, for many Jews, harks back to the days of Hebrew school, or to a time when their own kids were huddled around the table. This year, in honor of the first of the High Holy Days, revel in the sweetness of the coming Jewish new year with festive, honey-laced treats that are blissfully sweet and celebratory. </h4>

    							<li class="li li__directions--modal">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
    							<li class="li li__directions--modal">Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil. Finely grind the biscotti in a food processor. Add the melted butter and process until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom (not the sides) of the prepared pan. Bake until the crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Cool the crust completely on a cooling rack.</li>
    							<li class="li li__directions--modal">Blend the ricotta in a clean food processor until smooth. Add the cream cheese and sugar and blend well, stopping the machine occasionally and scraping down the sides of the work bowl. Blend in the honey and orange zest. Add the eggs and pulse just until blended.</li>
    							<li class="li li__directions--modal">Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan. Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake until the cheesecake is golden and the center of the cake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour and 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold).</li>
    							<li class="li li__directions--modal" id="margin-bottom-modal">Transfer the cake to a rack and cool 1 hour. Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days. Cut the cake into wedges and serve.</li>
